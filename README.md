# Autonomous Orchestration Ecosystem

A self-evolving sub-agent management system for Claude Code. Instead of using pre-defined abstract agents, let the orchestrator dynamically create, integrate, and evolve agents based on actual task requirements.

## Concept

The system implements an **Infinite Evolution Cycle**:

```
Implementation → Initial Sub-agent Pool → Orchestrator Engine
                                              ↓
                                    Specialized Sub-agents
                                              ↓
                                    1st Gen Integration
                                              ↓
                                    2nd Gen Integration
                                              ↓
                                    Hyper-Elite Integration
                                              ↓
                                    Ultimate Elite Integration
                                              ↓
                                    Hyper-Elite Integrated Entity
                                              ↓
                                    ← Infinite Evolution Cycle →
```

## Key Features

- **Task-driven agent creation**: Agents are born from real task requirements, not abstract definitions
- **Dynamic integration**: Merges agents when synergy improves outcomes
- **Continuous evolution**: Strong agents evolve through generations, weak ones fade
- **Elite promotion**: High-performing agents are promoted to elite status
- **Lineage tracking**: Integrated agents remember their parents, enabling evolution chains

## Usage: Slash Command

**Use the `/task` slash command to activate the orchestration system.**

```
/task Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication
```

This command triggers the full orchestration workflow:
1. Reads `orchestrator.md`
2. Scans `pool/` for existing agents
3. Calculates coverage against task requirements
4. Creates/integrates/selects the optimal agent
5. Executes the task
6. Updates metrics in `manifests/`
7. Promotes high-performers to `elite/`

### Why Slash Command?

Without the slash command, the orchestration system will **not automatically activate**. The `/task` command ensures:
- Orchestrator logic is always read first
- Agent pool is scanned before execution
- Metrics are updated after completion
- Evolution cycle continues

## How It Works

### 1. Task Analysis

When `/task` is invoked, the orchestrator:
- Scans the existing agent pool
- Calculates coverage rate against task requirements

### 2. Decision Matrix

| Coverage Rate | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **90%+** | Use existing agent directly |
| **60-90%** | Create integrated agent from multiple sources |
| **Below 60%** | Create new specialized agent |

### 3. Evolution Tracking

After task completion:
- Update agent metrics (usage_count, success_rate)
- Promote high-performers to elite status

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy files

```bash
cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/

# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item -Recurse .claude C:\path\to\your\project\
```

### 2. Add to CLAUDE.md

Add the content from `CLAUDE.md` to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Agent Orchestration

**Must**: Use `/task` command to execute tasks through the orchestrator.

### Core Principle

**Do NOT use pre-defined abstract agents.** Instead:
1. Create specialized agents from actual task requirements
2. Integrate existing agents when synergy improves outcomes
3. Let the agent pool evolve through continuous improvement
```

### 3. Start using with `/task`

```
/task Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Scan `pool/` - find no existing agents
2. Coverage: 0% → Create new specialized agent
3. Save to `pool/specialized/auth-api-specialist.md`
4. Create skill sheet `manifests/auth-api-specialist.yaml`
5. Execute task with the new agent

## Example Evolution

**First task**:
```
/task Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication

Orchestrator: No existing agents → Create specialized agent
→ Saved: pool/specialized/auth-api-specialist.md
→ Created: manifests/auth-api-specialist.yaml
```

**Second task**:
```
/task Add database validation to the auth API

Orchestrator: auth-api-specialist (70%) + need DB skills
→ Create integrated agent
→ Saved: pool/integrated/merged-auth-db.md
→ Created: manifests/merged-auth-db.yaml (parent_agents: [auth-api-specialist])
```

**After 5+ successful tasks with 80%+ success rate**:
```
Orchestrator: merged-auth-db qualifies for elite
→ Moved: pool/integrated/merged-auth-db.md → pool/elite/merged-auth-db.md
→ Updated: manifests/merged-auth-db.yaml (tier: elite)
```
